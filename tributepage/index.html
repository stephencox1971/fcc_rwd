    <p id="intro">Although not the inventor of AC electrical technology, Tesla’s inventions were the most successful, particularly in introducing the long distance transmission of electricity, without which much of twentieth century technology would be impossible. Unafraid to pass high voltages through his body to demonstrate to the public the safety of AC electricity, he truly was an electrical genius.</p>

    <ul>
      <h2 id="headline">Here's a time line of Tesla's life:</h2>
      <li><strong>1856</strong> - Born an ethnic Serb in what is now Croatia, son of an Eastern Orthodox priest.</li>

      <li><strong>1887</strong> - Develops an AC motor, superior to others already developed as well as a power system suitable for the long distance delivery of electricity.</li>
      <li><strong>1888</strong> - Partners with Westinghouse Electric. Westinghouse license the patents for his electrical technology.</li>
      <li><strong>1889</strong> - Tesla opens a laboratory in Manhattan. Develops the Tesla coil.</li>
      <li><strong>1893</strong> - Assists Westinghouse in lighting the Chicago World Fair and pursuing the contract for the Hydroelectric power station at Niagara Falls.</li>
      <li><strong>1894</strong> - Begins experimenting with X-rays.</li>
      <li><strong>1898</strong> - Develops radio controlled boat. Unsuccessfully tries to sell it to the US Military as a remote controlled torpedo.</li>
      <li><strong>1899</strong> - Opens laboratory in Colorado Springs to investigate wireless telegraphy and power transmission.</li>
      <li><strong>1901</strong> - Partners with J.P.Morgan to build a world transmission system.</li>
      <li><strong>1902</strong> - Work begins on the Wardenclyffe tower. It is never finished due to lack of funds.</li>
      <li><strong>1906</strong> - Demonstrates a blameless turbine, but it is never perfected.</li>
      <li><strong>1915</strong> - Sues Marconi for patent infringement  of his wireless technology.</li>
      <li><strong>1934</strong> - Announces plan for a “Death Ray".
      </li>
      <li><strong>1943</strong> - Dies at the age of 86.</li>
